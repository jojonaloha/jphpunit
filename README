jphpUnit
Jonathan's simple php unit tester.

This is a super simple unit testing class for php. This came about when I
found myself without internet and needing to write a few unit tests. So, I
threw this simple class together. I wanted my class to function similarly
to PHPUnit, so it generates similarly formatted output and you call it and
write your unit tests very similarly, but this class only provides a very
small fraction of the features that you would get out of PHPUnit.
